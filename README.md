1. Java Version VSCODE
   - I already had JDK 17.0.1 installed but brief & Play Framework required Java 11 or less.
   - Did not want to uninstall JDK 17.
   - Have both installed on computer - added a variable to path for JAVA_HOME and a java/scripts folder to change JAVA_HOME to whichever corresponding bat I use.
   - Can change JDK by typing "Java11" into the command line, to change back type "Java17".
   - NB: if change doesnt work, ensure bat file has correct corresponding JDK path.
